# PocketBeagle Grove Kit Hands-On Coding Workshop

* microSD software image and other materials available from bbb.io/grove

See bbb.io/start for instructions on using Etcher.io to write a microSD card

TODO: Add image for getting-started web page

TOOD: Determine if all wires should be hooked up in this phase.

Plug into the microUSB on PocketBeagle to provide power and a network connection. Look for the “heartbeat” pulse on the USR0 LED to know the board has Linux up-and-running.

# Blink PocketBeagle on-board USRx LED
**Goal:** Blink USR3 LED on PocketBeagle  
**Overview:** Python is a popular programming language used by beginners. Linux exposes hardware interfaces as files, making it easy to use any programming language to interact with hardware. Here we will use Python and Linux to blink an LED built into your PocketBeagle.  
**Do this in the Cloud9 IDE:**

1. Navigate to *PocketBeagle/Grove/internalLED.py* and double-click on it.
2. Click the ```Run``` button in the toolbar to execute the script in the ```active file window```.
3. You will see the ```run configuration window``` open with a ```Stop``` button.  Click the ```Stop``` button to halt the program.
4. Try changing the LED or blink time, save the program and run again.

## internalLED.py

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import time
state = 0 # Initial state
led = open('/sys/class/leds/beaglebone:green:usr3/brightness', 'w')
while True:
  print(state, file=led)
  led.flush()
  if(state == 1):
    state = 0
  else:
    state = 1
  time.sleep(0.25)
```

# Read a button

**Goal:** Sense the external world by reading a digital input.  
**Overview:** Reading a switch attached to a GPIO (general purpose input/output) port isn't
as easy as just reading and writing a file anymore. They call that progress. Learn how to
map the Grove ports to PocketBeagle pins to OSD3358 balls to AM3358 balls to GPIO identifiers
and access them using ```libgpiod```.
 Note the
buttons are “active low”.  
**Do this in the Cloud9 IDE:**

1. Navigate to TechLab/pushbutton.js and double-click on it.
2. Click the Run button in the toolbar to execute the script in the active file window
3. Press the “L” button on TechLab and check the output  (Value=1 or Value=0)  in the configuration window.      Click the Stop button on the IDE to halt the program. 

**Challenge #1:** Can you modify the program to read from the “R” button?
**Challenge #2:** Can you modify the program to toggle the USR3 LED?
**Challenge #3:** Can you modify the program to turn the USR3 LED on with the “L” button and off with the “R” button?
