# Grove modules

This is a set of examples for using Seeed Grove modules with PocketBeagle, primarily using
the BeagleBoard.org PocketBeagle Grove Cape, but some other wiring options are examined as
well.

Forthcoming documentation fixes: https://github.com/SeeedDocument/wiki_english/pull/28

## I2C1/I2C2

To use these ports as 3.3V I2C, the default configuration should be ready-to-go. Depending
on the sensor you are using, you'll simply need to enable the kernel driver and interact
using the newly created SYSFS entries. This is easy and can be quickly learned by example.

Take the [Grove - 3 Axis Digital Accelerometer](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-3-Axis_Digital_Accelerometer-16g/)
as a first example. As long as the kernel and overlay library are new enough, you'll
simply need to write to a file to load the overlay with configuration information,
triggering the loading of the driver. Note that the overlay file specifies the I2C port
where the sensor is connected, so you'll need to choose the correct overlay file based
on the port.

In this directory, you'll find numerous examples in various programming languages to
perform this task, but you can also simply do everything necessary from the Linux
command shell. You'll see the shell in your Cloud9 IDE window as 'bash'. Simply type
in these lines to read from the accelerometer connected on I2C2.

TODO: Ugh. Most drivers need interrupts and the Grove modules don't have them. :-(

TODO: Ugh. The Seeed provided driver is an input driver, not an iio driver. :-(

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/adxl34x
sudo dd if=/lib/firmware/BB-I2C2-ADXL34X.dtbo of=/sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/adxl34x/dtbo
cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device1/in_accel_x_raw
```

The first line tells the kernel we'd like to add a new overlay, the second line provides the
overlay data loading the driver and the third line reads the sensor. If you have more
sensor drivers loaded, the ```iio:device1``` might be incremented to ```iio:device2```
or whatever the next available index is.

Note that 

To read it continuously, you can do something like:

```sh
watch -n0 cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device1/in_distance_raw
```

The summary of SYSFS entries (virtual files) providing an interface to the module are
documented at https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-iio.  You
should look for the interfaces typical for the type of sensor.

The following table provides a summary of I2C sensors, the name of the driver, the
default I2C address, and the minimal kernel revision to support the sensor. The kernel
version also includes a link to the kernel module source code.
